# Text-Recognition-Using-Tesseract
The program uses Tesseract OCR and Open cv majorly to extract the text from the images
<p>
  I Built the program with refering multiple codes for help online but none of them were suitable so ended up creating this program.
  The program is built for extracting the text from number plates.</p>
<h6>Why is the program better?</h6>
<p>The program works well with all the number plates where the characters are used properly<br>
The program uses tesseract OCR which is one of the widely used OCR's out there. </p>
